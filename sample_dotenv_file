# NEVER add RAILS_MASTER_KEY to source control; I am only doing it for demo purposes

# To run the production app locally, create your RDS and make it publicly accessible;
# add a security group making Postgres port 5432 open to either the world or your IP;
# update this file with the appropriate values.  If you need these values
# spelled out, create a Secrets Manager secret from this RDS.  You will still
# need to have remembered the username and password.  RDS_DB_NAME will be called
# dbInstanceIdentifier in Secrets Manager.

# I recommended removing the security group and making your DB instance private
# after verifying the dockerized app runs.

# To run the production dockerized app from localhost, do this:
# docker build -t my_art_gallery .
# docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env my_art_gallery
# Access at http://localhost:3000
